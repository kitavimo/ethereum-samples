# Ethereum for Web Developers

Code samples for the _Ethereum for Web Developers_ book. Each folder on this repository corresponds to a chapter in the book, and includes instructions on how to run its code.

## Environment setup

All code samples are written in javascript, and are run using `node 10.16`. Most applications are bootstrapped via `create-react-app`, and rely on `web3.js` for connecting to the network, and `ganache-cli` to set up a development network. Run `npm install` on the project root to get all dependencies, as well as on each folder as you proceed through the chapters.
